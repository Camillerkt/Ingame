# ðŸŽ® What is Ingame?
The Ingame tool allows gamers to translate anything they write in their native language in chat into a language that other gamers use to chat (usually English).


# ðŸ’» How to install it?
This version uses Python to work. So we invite you to install Python on your machine as well as the following modules:
`pip install deep-translator`
`pip install pynput`

After installing these modules, all you have to do is launch the `Ingame.py` program with Python.

If you want to install the `Ingame.exe` version and not the Python one, please download Ingame from here : https://ingame.camillerakoto.fr


# ðŸ›  How to configure it?
When you start the Ingame program, it will ask you to enter the following values:

1. "What language should you translate your messages into": This is the destination language (https://ingame.camillerakoto.fr/docs/supported_languages.md)
2. "Choose your starting key": Enter the key you will use to start the translation (a key you never use usually : https://ingame.camillerakoto.fr/docs/all_keys.md).
3. "Choose your key combination to select your entire message in the chat": Enter your key combination to select the entire content of what you have written in the chat text field (ctrl+a is the default value but type cmd+a if you are on MacOS).


# ðŸš€ How do I start it?
Before playing your favourite game, **don't forget to launch the program**.
To activate the translation of the text you are writing, press the start key you have selected and write your text. Once you have written your text in the chat (in your native language), **don't forget to press the start button again to finish translating the text**.
Finally, the program will automatically replace what you have written in English (or other languages).


In case of bugs, try restarting the program and changing your start key.
When you have finished playing, close the program (Ingame).
